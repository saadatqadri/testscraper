Verify also that the time of last real-time data retrieval is updated on the display%Cleanup: None 
[SCREH13] SCADATOP Energization Test (Rehearsal Environment) % This test checks that SCADATOP issues a message notifying the user of a closed ground switch grounding an island. The closed ground switch is ignored and the devices comprising the island are not deemed grounded.  %  The user should start with the topology in a known state where running the SCADATOP topology analysis consecutive times results in no device connectivity/energization change messages being logged to the LOG, SCREH display. The SCREH, SCADATOP and TAGNOTES tasks should be up and the “Process Status” on the SCREH display should show “Ready for Rehearsal.” ,Procedure: 1.From a substation oneline display choose an energized area or island with an open ground switch.  2. Close the ground switch. 3. Depress the “Analyze Topology” button (shown below) on the SCREH display to initiate a topology analysis. %  1. A popup, similar to the one below, is displayed indicating the closed ground switch. The message on the popup window should identify the closed ground switch. 2.     Since the closed ground switch is deemed an error and ignored, the state of the area (or island) does not change.   ,Verification  No messages are issued to the LOG display indicating device connectivity/energization changes%Cleanup: Open the ground switch. Additional Testing: Perform the test after closing multiple ground switches. After running topology analysis a popup message should be issued for each closed ground switch. There should be no device connectivity/energization changes as the closed ground switches should be considered errors and ignored.
[SCREH14] Realtime Environment% This test checks that SCADATOP, running in an EMS or DTS environment, issues an alarm if a live island is grounded by a closed ground switch. The closed ground switch is ignored and the devices comprising the island are not deemed grounded.  % The SCADATOP should be up and running in an EMS or DTS environment. Choose a substation with a live island, or area, containing an open ground switch%Procedure: From the substation oneline display close the ground switch. (SCADATOP should perform a topology analysis, but if it does not, change that state of a topology device to initiate an analysis) % An alarm is issued indicating the closed ground switch grounding an island. The characteristics of the alarm are chosen by the customer but the alarm text may contain the composite key of the closed ground switch%Verification  Call up the system activity display to view thealarm. The display where the alarm can be viewed depends on the customer chosen characteristics of the alarm, but the hardcoded exception is “TPA010.” ,Cleanup: Open the ground switch. Additional Testing: Perform the test after closing multiple ground switches. After running topology analysis an alarm should be issued for each closed ground switch. There should be no device ground changes as the closed ground switches should be considered errors and ignored.
[SCREH15] Setting CB Devices to the normal state % This test checks that POINT records of parent DEVTYP record with id ‘CB’ are set to their normal state. %  The SCREH, SCADATOP and TAGNOTES tasks should be up and the “Process Status” on the SCREH display should show “Ready for Rehearsal.” ,Procedure:  1.     Select a few CB devices not in their normal state. Or, change a few CB devices from their normal state.  2.     From the SCREH display, depress the button (shown below) to set CB devices to the normal state.  3.     Choose OK from the confirmation popup. % The CB devices are changed to the normal state%Verification 1.Messages are logged on the REHEARSAL_LOG display indicating the start and end of action. 2. A message is logged on LOG display for each POINT record changed to the normal state%Cleanup: None.
